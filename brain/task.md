# Project Tasks

- [x] Workspace initialization & state management setup

- [x] Phase 2A: Core Dispatcher Proof-of-Concept (`CLS`, `ECHO`, `EXIT`, Command Loop)
  - [x] Kick Assembler toolchain setup and verification
  - [x] PETSCII API layer (`src/command64/petsci.asm`)
  - [x] Command loop, dispatcher, built-in handlers (`src/command64/shell.asm`)
  - [x] Build entry point and segment layout (`build/command64.asm`)
  - [x] Constants and KERNAL equates (`include/command64.inc`)
  - [x] `build/command64.prg` assembles — 0 errors, 0 warnings

- [x] Phase 2A Code Review & Remediation (2026-05-02)
  - [x] Static review: 14 findings (11 Critical, 3 Major) — `brain/reviews/2026-05-02_phase2a-command64.md`
  - [x] All findings remediated — `brain/plans/2026-05-02_phase2a-command64-code-review-remediation.md`
  - [x] Real-hardware test: `CLS` works, `ECHO` crashes fixed, `EXIT` hang fixed
  - [x] CommandBuffer relocated from $0300 (KERNAL vectors!) to $1400
  - [x] cmdCompare X-register dispatch bug fixed (all 3 commands verified)
  - [x] EXIT: `jmp ($0338)` → `jmp $E37B` (BASIC warm start ROM)

- [/] Phase 2A Follow-on (open)
  - [ ] Raw GETIN input loop — fixes `"` quote-mode control code injection
  - [ ] VMM API specification (`include/vmm.inc`)

- [ ] Phase 2B: External command support / PATH search
