# Project Tasks

- [x] Workspace initialization & state management setup

- [x] Phase 2A: Core Dispatcher Proof-of-Concept (`CLS`, `ECHO`, `EXIT`, Command Loop)
  - [x] Kick Assembler toolchain setup and verification
  - [x] PETSCII API layer (`src/command64/petsci.asm`)
  - [x] Command loop, dispatcher, built-in handlers (`src/command64/shell.asm`)
  - [x] Build entry point and segment layout (`build/command64.asm`)
  - [x] Constants and KERNAL equates (`include/command64.inc`)
  - [x] `build/command64.prg` assembles — 0 errors, 0 warnings

- [x] Phase 2A Code Review & Remediation (2026-05-02)
  - [x] Static review: 14 findings (11 Critical, 3 Major) — `brain/reviews/2026-05-02_phase2a-command64.md`
  - [x] All findings remediated — `brain/plans/2026-05-02_phase2a-command64-code-review-remediation.md`
  - [x] Real-hardware test: `CLS` works, `ECHO` crashes fixed, `EXIT` hang fixed
  - [x] CommandBuffer relocated from $0300 (KERNAL vectors!) to $1400
  - [x] cmdCompare X-register dispatch bug fixed (all 3 commands verified)
  - [x] EXIT: `jmp ($0338)` → `jmp $E37B` (BASIC warm start ROM)

- [x] Phase 2A Follow-on (open)
  - [x] Raw GETIN input loop — fixes `"` quote-mode control code injection
  - [x] Fix Y-register clobbering in PETSCII/Shell routines
  - [x] Fix PETSCII string encoding bug (block graphics in badCmdMsg)
  - [x] Improve parser robustness (ignore empty lines, trim spaces)
  - [x] VMM API specification (`include/vmm.inc`)

- [x] Phase 2B: External command support / PATH search
  - [x] Define loader memory map ($2000+)
  - [x] Implement directory search (`path.asm`) with auto-.prg extension
  - [x] Implement binary loader (`loader.asm`) with custom address support
  - [x] Integrate with `shellDispatch` (auto-run if no internal match)
  - [x] Case-insensitive matching (`normalizeName`)
  - [x] Create test environment (`tests/testcmds.d64`)

- [x] Phase 2B Verification
  - [x] Verify `HELLO` from shell (string output)
  - [x] Verify `COLOR` from shell (visual check)
  - [x] Verify `EXTCLS` from shell (functionality check)
  - [x] Verify case-insensitivity (e.g., `hello` vs `HELLO`)
  - [x] Verify custom load address (e.g., `load hello 3000`)
