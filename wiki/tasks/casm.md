# CASM Native Assembler

Status: [x]
Taskwarrior: 29 (`13a45324`)
Plan: `brain/plans/2026-07-16-casm-phase1-native-application-scaffold.md`

## Goal

Implement `casm` as a native Command 64 external application that assembles
documented 6502/6510 source on the C64 and emits static or Command 64
R6-relocatable PRG files.

## Current Milestone

Phase 1 establishes the native application scaffold. It must build through the
existing ca65/ld65 application pipeline, ship on the release disk, print its
complete version, execute centralized cleanup, and return safely to the shell.
It does not parse source or perform assembly.

## Phase 1 Prerequisite

- [x] User confirms the Phase 0 memory, resource, diagnostic, version, and
      initial link-size contracts required by the Phase 1 plan.

Source implementation must not begin until this gate is satisfied.

## Phase 1 Subtasks

- [x] Task UUID `ef6a001e`: create synchronized task records and the
      CASM-local DOX contract.
- [x] Task UUID `7b318ab7`: declare the approved zero-page, bounded base-RAM,
      and module ABI.
- [x] Task UUID `05e59de2`: implement central resource ownership, cleanup,
      and exit paths.
- [x] Task UUID `8891fe27`: implement minimal fixed-string diagnostics.
- [x] Task UUID `eb83b449`: implement the PRG entry point and complete version
      banner.
- [x] Task UUID `c6c3b55e`: register the ca65 target and add CASM to the
      release disk.
- [x] Task UUID `5a0e36c5`: verify configure, standalone build, R6 artifact,
      and disk image.
- [x] Task UUID `161ed5a9`: record the walkthrough and obtain user runtime
      confirmation.

## Phase 1 Acceptance

- [x] CASM-local DOX and memory ownership are documented.
- [x] `cmake --build build --target casm` succeeds.
- [x] The generated `casm.prg` has a valid PRG header and R6 footer.
- [x] A no-change rebuild does not increment `BUILD_CASM`.
- [x] `cmake --build build --target image_d64` succeeds.
- [x] The release disk directory contains `CASM` without losing another app.
- [x] All terminal paths pass through repeat-safe central cleanup.
- [x] The user launches CASM, confirms the version banner, and confirms safe
      return to an intact shell twice in succession.
- [x] A walkthrough records build evidence and manual confirmation steps.
- [x] The user explicitly approves marking Phase 1 done.

## Completion

Completed 2026-07-16. The user confirmed all runtime walkthrough steps passed
in local emulation and approved marking Phase 1 done.

## Verification Policy

- Do not use the broken `c64-testing` MCP.
- Do not use a web emulator.
- Build and inspect artifacts with repository tooling.
- The user performs runtime verification in the supported local emulator or
  on hardware.
- Do not mark the milestone done before the user confirms the walkthrough.
